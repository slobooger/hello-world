Uh, Hello?

I am Justin. I enjoy making. I am learning about the Beaglebone Black.
I wish there were more demand for the BeagleBone Black, as it really truly is a marvelous device for the maker community.

It is not like the PI, which is basically just a computer.... the Beaglebone as real time micro-controllers built in!
